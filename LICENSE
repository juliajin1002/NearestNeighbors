XSEDE Software Copyright and Licensing Guidance and Template Files

# Developer Procedures

Put the XSEDE/LICENSE-template LICENSE.txt and NOTICE files into the base directory for your
software source and deployment directories, replacing other license or copyright notice files.
If you use LICENSE-template as a template when creating a new GIT repository, make sure to
replace README.md with your software specific README.

This guidance applies to all software developed by the XSEDE program, whether maintained in
https://github.com/XSEDE, bitbucket, https://software.xsede.org/svn/, or elsewhere.

## Individually developed or single-site software
For software that is developed by a single individual or by persons all employed by the same
subawardee, the standard practices of that subawardee institution can be applied instead.
The subaward agreements allow subawardees to claim copyright on software developed by their
staff. For the approved practices in such situations, contact the appropriate office at your
institution.

# Background
Modern software development best practices include associating copyright and licensing
information with the code. XSEDE presents an interesting challenge in that (a) XSEDE itself
is not an entity that can either hold a copyright or enforce a license, (b) much XSEDE software
is collaboratively developed by persons at different XSEDE subawardee sites, and (c) XSEDE has
a goal of producing open-source software, in line with the practices and expectations of most
NSF awardees. Because of these unusual situations, the normal approaches of applying copyright
and license information do not apply to XSEDE software.

Because the University of Illinois (UIUC) is the prime XSEDE awardee, we worked with the UIUC
legal department to determine a suitable approach that can be consistently applied across XSEDE
projects.

The approved licensing and copyright language from UIUC legal is in the NOTICE file. UIUC legal
did confirm that we can adapt the language to other open-source licenses, with the caveat that
"we can freely modify the license only if we are owners of the code (e.g., we cannot modify other
people’s contributions to a different license).”
