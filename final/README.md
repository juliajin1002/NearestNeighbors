# Portuguese Bank Marketing Campaign

Final Project report: file:///Users/chaoranjin/Documents/NearestNeighbors/final/Final_Project.html

We analyzed a Portuguese bank’s marketing campaign that took place between May 2008 and November 2010. 
During the campaign, telemarketers called potential customers to persuade them to subscribe to a bank term deposit. 
During these calls, they recorded key demographic information such as age, job, marital and education status. 
Telemarketers also noted information about customers’ current accounts like balance, housing, loan, and default records, 
as well as data about the campaign itself including the timing and duration of their call. 
Critically, they also documented the outcome of their efforts: whether or not a potential customer subscribed to the bank term deposit.
